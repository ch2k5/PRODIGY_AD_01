Project Overview: Calculator App for Android
During my Android development internship at Prodigy Info Tech, my first task was to develop a simple yet feature-rich calculator app. The app performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation. It features a user-friendly interface with support for both normal and dark modes, enhancing user experience across different lighting conditions.

One of the standout features is the history function, allowing users to navigate back to their 4th previous calculation result. For error handling, I incorporated a stylable toast library to deliver a polished experience when exceptions occur.

Challenges and Learning Experience
The most time-consuming part was developing the logic for handling all user exceptions gracefully, as it was more complex than expected. I faced multiple challenges in dealing with edge cases and bugs, but testing the app continuously allowed me to identify and resolve issues, refining the overall functionality.

Key Takeaway
The biggest lesson I learned from this project is the importance of being a thorough app tester. Consistent testing not only helped me uncover hidden bugs but also improved my problem-solving skills, making the app more reliable.
